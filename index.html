                   <b>Jude Bellingham needs no introduction after underlining his generational talent at the World Cup with England.
                    
                    Bellingham, 19, started all five matches and was a shining light in Qatar while Manchester City are said to be desperate to be front and centre whenever he opts to leave Borussia Dortmund. It might be sooner rather than later, following those coming-of-age displays on a global platform.
                    
                    It was not exactly surprising to see Bellingham take centre stage. He has long since been tipped for the summit as the story continues from Birmingham to Dortmund, and onto Manchester or Madrid?
                    Bellingham, quite simply, has the footballing world at his feet, and he grew in stature on and off the pitch over the last few weeks. He might, one day, bring it home and Pep Guardiola has waxed lyrical about his dream signing a few times before, while Jack Grealish has since confirmed that theory.
                    
                    Bellingham wowed Guardiola during their Champions League meeting this season. Albeit in a losing cause, the 19-year-old scored at the Etihad Stadium and caught the eye with his mature performance, while he has also donned the Dortmund captain's armband several times this campaign despite his tender age.
                    Speaking in September, the City manager said of Bellingham: "Quality and skills, everyone knows about it, but it's not just about that. It's about the whole package.
                    
                    "He's really good and he's already in the national team playing with them at 19. That's quite impressive but, as I said when he was 17, it wasn't just the quality, it was about he was shouting, leading and going to the referee.
                    "I thought that this guy was something special in terms of his mentality. Now, at 19 years old, he is already one the captains in the [Dortmund] team and, when that happens at 19, it's quite impressive Jude Bellingham needs no introduction after underlining his generational talent at the World Cup with England.
